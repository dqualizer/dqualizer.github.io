        <p>
          The runtime quality of application systems - e.g. in terms of performance, reliability and resilience - has a
          direct influence
          on the business success of companies in a wide range of technical domains. As a result, it is important to
          continuously monitor,
          evaluate and, if necessary, improve runtime quality through analysis measures. Over the last few years,
          corresponding analysis
          measures such as load tests or monitoring have become widespread in practice and mature commercial and
          open-source tools have
          been developed. However, these measures are all located at the technical level and are not interpreted at the
          domain an level.
          At the same time, software architecture and software development approaches such as Domain-Driven Design
          (DDD), which are
          becoming increasingly widespread, essentially do not consider runtime quality concerns despite their
          criticality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The research project dqualizer of Novatec Consulting GmbH and the University of Hamburg aims at closing this
          gap between the
          domain-specificity of application systems and the (technical) measures and findings of quality assurance by
          means of a
          domain-centric approach. For this purpose, possibilities for modeling and monitoring runtime quality concerns
          are to be
          integrated into DDD-based techniques. From a domain perspective, meaningful load and resilience tests can be
          automatically
          generated and interpreted by dqualizer and the links to technical monitoring can be established. The
          innovative concepts
          developed are to be implemented in an open source tool and made available and usable in connection with
          existing tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The connection of the joint research project of Novatec Consulting GmbH and the University of Hamburg with
          industry partners is
          intended to establish the link to practice and evaluate the approach using real case studies in the complex
          technical domains of
          insurance and payroll/tax accounting and the corresponding technical environments. The case studies will be
          provided by the
          associated application partners. The consortium is already working together in various sub-constellations.
          Novatec can expand
          its offering through dqualizer into both business-driven architecture consulting and runtime quality analysis,
          and in particular
          merge the two areas. For the University of Hamburg, there are extensive opportunities for exploiting the
          results in research and
          teaching.
